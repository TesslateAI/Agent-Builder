    *   Customize an agent's system prompt or its list of enabled tools.
    *   Define parameters for patterns (e.g., which agent is the router in a `RouterPattern`).
    *   Set the content for a `Text Input` node.
4.  **Extend (Optional):** Use the **Add Code** tab in the sidebar to register new TFrameX agents or tools by pasting Python code. They'll appear in the "Components" tab.
5.  **AI Assist (Optional):** Use the **AI Flow Builder** chat to describe changes or additions to your flow, and let the AI attempt to update the canvas.
6.  **Run:** Click the "Run Flow" button in the Top Bar to execute your entire visual flow.
7.  **Iterate:** Observe the results in the **Output Panel**, refine your design, and run again!

## üìã Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.8+**
*   **TFrameX Library:** Ensure TFrameX is installed in your Python environment.
    ```bash
    pip install tframex
    ```
*   **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Required for the frontend.
*   **LLM API Access:** An OpenAI-compatible API endpoint (e.g., a local Ollama instance, vLLM, etc).
*   **Environment Variables:** Your backend needs to know how to connect to your LLM. See "Backend Setup" below.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Tesslate Studio up and running:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (Flask & TFrameX):**
    *   Navigate to the backend directory: `cd builder/backend`
    *   Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   Install Python dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   **Configure your LLM:**
        *   Copy the example environment file: `cp deploy/docker/.env.example deploy/docker/.env`
        *   Edit the `deploy/docker/.env` file with your LLM details. Example for local Ollama:
            ```env
            OPENAI_API_BASE="http://localhost:11434/v1"
            OPENAI_API_KEY="ollama" # Placeholder for Ollama
            OPENAI_MODEL_NAME="llama3" # Your preferred model
            ```
            For OpenAI API:
            ```env
            # OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_openai_api_key"
            # OPENAI_MODEL_NAME="gpt-3.5-turbo"
            # OPENAI_API_BASE="https://api.openai.com/v1" # (Often default)
            ```
    *   Run the backend server:
        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```
        The backend will typically start on `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.

3.  **Frontend Setup (React & Vite):**
    *   Open a new terminal.
    *   Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd builder/frontend`
    *   Install Node.js dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        # or if you use yarn:
        # yarn install
        ```
    *   Run the frontend development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        # or
        # yarn dev
        ```
        The frontend will typically start on `http://localhost:5173`.

4.  **Access Tesslate Studio:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).

## üß≠ Exploring the Interface

*   **Top Bar:**
    *   **Logo & Title:** "Tesslate Studio".
    *   **Project Management:** Select, create, save, or delete your visual flow projects.
    *   **Run Flow Button:** The primary button to execute the current visual flow on the canvas.

*   **Left Sidebar (Tabs):**
    *   **Components:** A palette of draggable TFrameX components:
        *   **Agents:** Your defined `LLMAgent`s, `ToolAgent`s.
        *   **Patterns:** `SequentialPattern`, `ParallelPattern`, `RouterPattern`, `DiscussionPattern`.
        *   **Tools:** Your registered TFrameX tools.
        *   **Utility:** Nodes like `Text Input` to feed initial data into your flows.
    *   **AI Flow Builder:** A chat interface to get AI assistance. Describe what you want to build or modify, and the AI will attempt to generate the ReactFlow JSON to update your canvas.
    *   **Add Code:** A panel where you can paste Python code defining new TFrameX agents or tools (using `@tframex_app.agent(...)` or `@tframex_app.tool(...)`). Successful registration makes them available in the "Components" tab.

*   **Main Canvas:** This is your workspace! A ReactFlow powered area where you drag components from the palette, connect their handles to define relationships, and arrange your visual flow.

*   **Right Panel (Tabs):**
    *   **Output:** Displays detailed logs and the final result from TFrameX when you run a flow. If your flow generates files (e.g., using a tool), preview links might appear here.
    *   **Properties:** This panel becomes active when you select a node on the canvas. It provides contextual options to configure the selected node:
        *   **Agent Nodes:** Edit display label, override the system prompt, manage which tools are enabled (tools are enabled by connecting them to the agent's dedicated tool input handle), toggle `strip_think_tags`, and configure template variables for the system prompt. A blue dot indicator shows if an agent's configuration is modified from its base TFrameX definition.
        *   **Pattern Nodes:** Edit display label and configure all necessary parameters for the specific pattern (e.g., list of agent/pattern names for `SequentialPattern`'s `steps`, the router agent for `RouterPattern`). Agent/Pattern parameters are often set by connecting other nodes to the pattern's input handles or by selecting from dropdowns.
        *   **Text Input Node:** Set the text content that this node will output.
        *   **Tool Nodes:** Primarily informational, showing the tool's name and description. Tools are "enabled" for agents by connecting the tool's attachment handle to an agent's tool input handle.

## üîß Key Features in Detail

### Visual Flow Construction
Drag components onto the canvas and connect their handles. Handles are color-coded or styled to indicate their purpose:
*   **Blue Handles (typically):** Standard message/data flow between agents and patterns.
*   **Purple Handles (on Tools/Agents):** Connect a Tool node to an Agent node to enable that tool for the agent.
*   **Amber Handles (on Patterns):** Connect an Agent or another Pattern to a Pattern's specific parameter input (e.g., assigning a `RouterAgent` to a `RouterPattern`).
*   **Green Handles (on Patterns):** Connect Agents to list-based parameters of a Pattern (e.g., adding agents to a `DiscussionPattern`'s participants).
*   Edges are styled (solid, dashed, animated) to visually differentiate connection types.

### Dynamic Code Registration
The "Add Code" tab allows you to paste Python code snippets that define new TFrameX agents or tools.
*   **Important:** Your code *must* use the globally available `tframex_app` instance for decorators (e.g., `@tframex_app.agent(...)`).
*   The backend executes this code, registering the new components with the running TFrameX application.
*   Upon successful registration, the new components will appear in the "Components" palette, ready to be used.

### AI Flow Builder
Chat with an AI assistant to help build your flows.
*   The AI considers your text prompt, the list of available TFrameX components, and the current state of your visual flow on the canvas.
*   It attempts to generate a new ReactFlow JSON structure (nodes and edges) that you can apply to your canvas.

### Execution and Overrides
When you click "Run Flow":
1.  The frontend sends the current visual graph (nodes and edges) to the backend.
2.  The backend's `flow_translator.py` intelligently converts this visual representation into an executable `tframex.Flow` object.
3.  **Important:** Agent configurations made in the Studio's Properties Panel (like system prompt overrides or specific tool selections for a node) are applied as *temporary overrides* for that specific agent instance *within that run*. This means your base TFrameX agent definitions (in your Python code) are not permanently altered by the Studio unless you explicitly re-register them via the "Add Code" panel. This allows for flexible experimentation in the UI.

## üîó How Tesslate Studio Works with TFrameX

*   **Studio as the Conductor:** Tesslate Studio acts as the visual conductor, allowing you to define *how* TFrameX components interact.
*   **TFrameX as the Orchestra:** TFrameX is the underlying engine that provides the agents, tools, patterns, and executes the actual LLM calls and logic.
*   **Translation Layer:** The backend of Tesslate Studio (specifically `flow_translator.py` and `component_manager.py`) is responsible for:
    *   Discovering agents, tools, and patterns from your TFrameX application.
    *   Translating the visual graph from the frontend into a TFrameX `Flow` object.
    *   Managing temporary, run-specific configurations for agents based on your UI settings.
    *   Dynamically registering new Python-defined components into the TFrameX application.
