Validation Outputs:
- **Pass/Fail Status**: Overall validation result
- **Error Details**: Specific validation failures with field names
- **Warning Messages**: Potential issues that don't fail validation
- **Suggestions**: Recommended fixes for invalid data
- **Statistics**: Count of valid/invalid records, error patterns
