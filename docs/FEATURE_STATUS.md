docker-compose -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml ps
```

## üìù Notes for Contributors

When adding new features:
1. Update this document to reflect the current status
2. Mark features as "Partially Implemented" during development
3. Move to "Currently Implemented" only when fully functional
4. Keep documentation in sync with implementation status
